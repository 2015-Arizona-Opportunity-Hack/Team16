Problem Statement:
The United Food Bank (UFB) currently has a website from which potential volunteers can download and print PDF volunteer forms. They would then fill out these hard-copy forms and bring them to UFB when they volunteer. The UFB staff would then need to manually input all of this information to the Microsoft Access database.

This project will automate the process of managing volunteer information by giving the volunteers the opportunity to submit their information online via the UFB website. This information would then be automatically pulled into the Microsoft Access database.
